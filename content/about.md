## Hi there

{{< image src="/img/me.jpg" alt="Wendell Adriel" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

My name is **Wendell Adriel**.

I'm a **Brazilian Software Engineer** living in **Portugal** since 2016 that loves
**Software Architecture** and **Software Design**. I started to work with **Software Development**
in 2009, and I love to share what I know with others.

I worked on many projects with many technologies, but I prefer to work on **Back-end** solutions.
My main stack for Back-end is **PHP** and I have a lot of experience with **Laravel**.
I also like to work with **Go** and I have the knowledge to work with **Node.js**, **Java** and
**Python** as well. I can work with **Front-end** technologies as well and I have good knowledge
of **JavaScript**.

Besides **Software Development**, I'm also an **Investor**, **Amateur Photographer** and **Musician**.
